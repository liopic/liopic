# Julio Martínez

As a seasoned developer with over 18 years of experience, I specialize in Data
Engineering, as well as Backend Development; mastering languages like Python,
Scala, SQL; on cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, Databricks; with the use of
Spark, Aiflow, dbt, among others. Additionally, I have expertise in web
programming (PHP, Js), and possess a strong background in leading teams and
DevOps. My academic credentials include a Master's degree in NLP.

My development practices follow rigorous standards, including CI, CD, code
reviews, virtualization (Docker), agile methodology, clean code, and code
quality tools. I have extensive experience working remotely, both before and
after COVID, and have successfully managed projects both as a team member and
leader.

While prioritizing high-impact deliverables to my employer, I also maintain a
strong focus on code quality. Moreover, I have contributed to Open Source
projects and have been a speaker at numerous conferences and meetups.
